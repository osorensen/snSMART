# snSMART

The aim of the **snSMART** R package is to consolidate data simulation, sample size calculation and analysis functions for several snSMART (small sample sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial) designs under one library.

An snSMART is a multi-stage trial design where for a two-stage design, randomization  in  the  second  stage  depends  on  the  outcome  to  first  stage  treatment. snSMART  designs  require  that  the  same  outcome  is measured at the end of the first stage and at the end of the second stage. Additionally, the length of the first stage of the trial must be the same amount of time as the length for the second stage. snSMARTs are motivated by obtaining more information from a small sample of individuals with the primary goal to identify the superior first stage treatment or dosage level using both stages of data.  Data are shared across the two stages of the snSMART design to more precisely estimate the effect of the treatments given in the first stage.

## Installation

You can download and install **snSMART** with:

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Install devtools first if you haven't done so
library(devtools)
# install snSMART
devtools::install_github("sidiwang/snSMART")
library(snSMART)
```
