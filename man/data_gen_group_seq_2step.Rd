\description{
generate data for the Group Sequential snSMART with a two-step rule, which is designed based on the standard design of snSMART (3 treatments, non-responders re-randomized; binary outcome; with interim analysis)
Use BJSM (Bayesian Joint Stage Model) method to conduct interim and final analysis.
