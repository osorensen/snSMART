\usage{
JSRM_binary(data, six = TRUE, DTR = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data format produced by the \code{trial_dataset} function}

\item{six}{if TRUE, will run the six beta model, if FALSE will run the two
beta model. Default is \code{six = TRUE}}

\item{DTR}{if TRUE, will also return the expected response rate and its standard error of dynamic treatment regimens}
}
\value{
a \code{list} containing
\itemize{
\item{GEE_output}{ - original output of the GEE (geeglm) model}
\item{pi_hat}{ - estimate of response rate/treatment effect}
\item{sd_pi_hat}{ - standard error of the response rate}
\item{pi_DTR_hat}{ - expected response rate of dynamic treatment regimens (DTRs)}
\item{pi_DTR_se}{ - standard deviation of DTR estimates}
}
}
\description{
A joint-stage regression model (JSRM) is a frequentist modeling approach that incorporates the responses of both stages as repeated measurements for each subject.
Generalized estimating equations (GEE) are used to estimate the response rates of each treatment. The marginal response rates for each DTR can also be obtained based on the GEE results/
